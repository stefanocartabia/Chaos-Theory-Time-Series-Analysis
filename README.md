# Chaotic-Time-Series-Analysis

The high dimensionality and nonlinearity of human brain dynamics raise the question of whether electroencephalograms (EEGs) exhibit chaos. Since the mid-1980s, research has focused on the estimation of the Lyapunov exponent, an attractor invariant, that measures a fundament property of chaos: sensitivity to initial conditions. However, the conflicting needs for long, stationary, and noise-free EEGs, together with a lack of statistically rigorous estimation methods, have led to inconclusive findings. 
This dissertation investigates the existence of global chaotic dynamics and/or local instability in human EEGs by consistently estimating the maximum Lyapunov exponent through an indirect nonparametric neural network approach, which supports a statistical chaos test. The analysis of the UKB dataset, provided by the Epilepsy Center at the University of Bonn, reveals that, unlike normal brain activity, both seizures and interictal phases are associated with a significant reduction in system complexity. Moreover, global chaotic dynamics are identified during epileptic episodes, corroborating a theory previously proposed in the literature but not conclusively proven.
